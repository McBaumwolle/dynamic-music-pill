Dynamic Music Pill 🎵

A "Dynamic Island" inspired, adaptive music widget for GNOME Shell (45+).

This extension displays the currently playing media in a sleek, pill-shaped widget in the Dash or Top Panel, complete with album art colors, animations, and controls.

*Demo

Note: This is my first GNOME extension project! Feedback, code reviews, and contributions are highly welcome.

✨ Features

🎨 Adaptive UI: Background color transitions dynamically based on the average color of the current album art.

🔒 Universal Skip Lock: Prevents UI flickering during track changes (3s grace period) – works with keyboard, mouse, and dock controls.

🧠 Smart Player Switching: Automatically prioritizes the active music source (e.g., switches from Spotify to YouTube seamlessly).

🎧 Control: You can Resume/Pause the music by clicking it, or skip it with the mouse scroll.

📜 Scrolling Text: Long titles and artists scroll smoothly (can be toggled in settings).

✨ Visual Polish: Blur effects, smooth slide animations, and waveform visualization.

🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

Since this is an initial release (v1.0), please keep in mind:

Structure: The codebase is currently monolithic (extension.js contains most logic). I plan to refactor this into modules.

Dash Support: Optimized primarily for Dash to Dock or for the basic Dash.

🚀 Roadmap

[ ] Refactor code into separate classes/modules.

[ ] Improve positioning logic for default GNOME shell.

[ ] Compatibility with Dash to Panel and the Top Panel.

[ ] Long term: Explore replacing the actual app icon in the dock with the pill.

🤝 Contributing

I welcome contributions! If you have ideas on how to improve the architecture or implement new features (like the icon replacement), feel free to open a Pull Request or an Issue.
